                   <p>I love challenges. The harder the problem, the more exhilarating it is to solve. Iâ€™m a team player and I will give my all to any organization I work with. I have been in tech for over 4 years now and have specialized in software development for 2 years. This understanding paired with my programming knowledge enables me to build full-stack applications with a focus on a responsive user experience.</p>
